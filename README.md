# Wearable Epilepsy Device & MC Team 
## T4: Patterns Matching, Association, and Prediction

### Overview
There are five signals being received and monitored. Each signal carries whether an abnormality was detected or not.  The signals are used together and matched to known issue patterns that cause epileptic seizures. If the signals are associated with an issue pattern, then an epileptic seizure is predicted, and a message is produced.
