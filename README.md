# Wearable Epilepsy Device & MC Team 
## T4: Patterns Matching, Association, and Prediction

### Overview
Abnormalities within a person’s life signals may warn of an upcoming epileptic seizure. So, there will be five signals that the frequency will be monitored for. The signal frequencies will be compared to the patient’s normal statistics to determine if there is an abnormality. Abnormalities within the signals may match a pattern that is associated with an issue. If an issue is detected, a message for the epileptic seizure will be outputted.
