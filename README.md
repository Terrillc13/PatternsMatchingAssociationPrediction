# Wearable Epilepsy Device & MC Team 
## T4: Patterns Matching, Association, and Prediction

### Overview
There are five signals being received and monitored. Each signal carries whether an abnormality was detected or not.  The signals are used together and matched to known issue patterns that cause epileptic seizures.
